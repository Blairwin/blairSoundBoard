This sound board is to display tracks from my album: "Blair". 
It will use html, css, and javascript to showcase them! 
My plan is to add it to my performing website eventually.
I am still in the midst of creating it at the moment!
So far, it's been pretty straight forward, but I'd never used audio in a project before, so that's been a fun challenge. 
I'm really looking forward to making magic once I add the javascript parts!
